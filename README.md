# Lyric Sync
A program that uses @AssemblyAI's (https://github.com/AssemblyAI) Text-To-Speech capabilities to translate a given .mp3 song into a .json. This JSON is then parsed by the program, and the lyrics of the song are displayed exactly at the time said in the song, while the song plays in the background.

# Usage
1. Place a song in the /samples/songs folder (needs to have a .mp3 ending).
2. Run the song_to_json.py file, and choose the song you want to display the lyrics of (by selecting the corresponding number in the menu).
3. Run the game.py file, and choose the song you want to play in the background while displaying the lyrics in realtime!
